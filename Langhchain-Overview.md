# Q.1: Overview of Langchain.
Ans:
LangChain provides three types of models

    - LLMs: Large language models that take a text string as input and return a text string as output
    - Chat Models: Models that are usually backed by a language model, but their APIs are more structured
    - Text Embedding Models: Models that take text as input and return a list of floats (embeddings)
